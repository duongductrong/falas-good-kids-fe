You have multiple specialized rules:

- [TypeScript](./typescript.mdc) - TypeScript best practices and code style
- [Frontend Design](./frontend-design.mdc) - Frontend design best practices
- [React](./react.mdc) - React component patterns and best practices
- [Testing](./testing.mdc) - Testing standards and patterns
- [Git](./git.mdc) - Git commit and branching conventions
- [Security](./security.mdc) - Security best practices
- [Coding Style](./coding-style.mdc) - Coding style and best practices
- [Performance](./performance.mdc) - Performance best practices

Routing guidelines:
1. For each user request, first infer which domains are relevant.
2. Select 0–3 rules that best match the request, prefer the SINGLE most specific rule when possible.
3. If both security and performance apply, prioritize `security.mdc` first, then `performance.mdc`.
4. If no rule clearly matches, ignore all rules and answer normally.
